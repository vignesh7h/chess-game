# **Chess Game in C++ (OOP)**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **complete command-line-based Chess Game** implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++**. The game includes all essential chess functionalities such as piece movement, turn-based play, check detection, checkmate detection, stalemate detection, and comprehensive input validation. It serves as a fun way to play chess directly from the terminal and provides an excellent demonstration of C++ OOP concepts and game logic implementation.

**Latest Updates:**
- ✅ **Fixed coordinate system** - White pieces at bottom, Black pieces at top
- ✅ **Enhanced chess notation support** - Supports `e2 e4`, `Nf3`, `Qxf7` formats
- ✅ **Fixed checkmate detection** - Properly detects and announces checkmate
- ✅ **Removed # symbols** from empty squares for cleaner display
- ✅ **Improved pawn movement logic** - Correct direction and promotion
- ✅ **Added debug mode** for troubleshooting game states
- ✅ **Implemented Castling** - Both king-side (O-O) and queen-side (O-O-O) castling
- ✅ **Implemented En Passant** - Automatic pawn capture when opponent pawn moves two squares
- ✅ **Added AI Opponent** - Multiple difficulty levels with intelligent move generation
- ✅ **Added Save/Load System** - Game persistence with PGN and FEN support

## **Features**  
### **Core Chess Rules** ✅
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game is built using C++ classes for each chess piece and game logic.  
- **Chessboard Setup:** Standard 8x8 chessboard with proper initial placement of pieces.  
- **Turn-based Gameplay:** Alternating turns between **White** and **Black** players.
- **Complete Move Validation:** Ensures that:
  - Players move only their own pieces.
  - Moves follow the rules for each piece (e.g., pawns move forward, rooks in straight lines).
  - Checks if a move is valid on the board boundaries.
  - Prevents moves that would leave the player's own king in check.
  - Validates piece capture logic (can only capture opponent pieces).
- **Check Detection:** Detects when a king is in check and prevents illegal moves.
- **Checkmate Detection:** Automatically detects checkmate and ends the game.
- **Stalemate Detection:** Detects stalemate situations and declares a draw.
- **Pawn Promotion:** Automatically promotes pawns to Queens when reaching the opposite end.
- **Castling:** Both king-side (O-O) and queen-side (O-O-O) castling with proper validation.
- **En Passant:** Automatic pawn capture when opponent pawn moves two squares forward.

### **Enhanced User Experience** ✅
- **Display Board:** The current state of the board is displayed after each move.
- **Game Status Display:** Shows check, checkmate, and stalemate status.

```

### **Input Move Format:**  
The game supports multiple input formats:

**A. Chess Notation (Recommended):**
```plaintext
e2 e4          # Pawn from e2 to e4
Nf3            # Knight to f3
Qxf7           # Queen captures on f7
O-O            # Kingside castling
O-O-O          # Queenside castling
```

**B. Algebraic Notation:**
```plaintext
e4             # Pawn to e4 (auto-finds which pawn)
Nf3            # Knight to f3 (auto-finds which knight)
exd5           # Pawn on e-file captures on d5
```

**C. Numeric Coordinates (Alternative):**
```plaintext
6 4 4 4        # From e2 to e4
```
Where:
- `(x1, y1)` is the **source** coordinate (where the piece is).
- `(x2, y2)` is the **destination** coordinate (where the piece moves to).

### **Special Moves:**

**Castling:**
- **King-side castling:** `O-O` or `0-0` - King moves to g1/g8, Rook moves to f1/f8
- **Queen-side castling:** `O-O-O` or `0-0-0` - King moves to c1/c8, Rook moves to d1/d8
- **Requirements:** King and rook must not have moved, no pieces between them, king not in check

**En Passant:**
- **Automatic:** When a pawn moves two squares forward, the opponent can capture it en passant
- **Example:** White plays d2-d4, Black responds with e7-e5, White can capture with d4xe5
- **Timing:** Only available on the very next move

**Pawn Promotion:**
- **Automatic:** Pawns automatically promote to Queen when reaching the opposite end
- **Future enhancement:** Choice of promotion piece (Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen)

### **Piece Movement Rules:**

**Pawn (P/p):**
- Moves forward only (1 square, or 2 on first move)
- Captures diagonally forward only
- White pawns move UP (decreasing row numbers)
- Black pawns move DOWN (increasing row numbers)
- **En Passant:** Can capture opponent pawn that just moved two squares

**Knight (N/n):**
- L-shape movement (2 squares in one direction, 1 perpendicular)
- Can jump over pieces

**Bishop (B/b):**
- Moves diagonally any number of squares
- Cannot jump over pieces

**Rook (R/r):**
- Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares
- Cannot jump over pieces

**Queen (Q/q):**
- Moves in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Cannot jump over pieces

**King (K/k):**
- Moves 1 square in any direction
- Cannot move into check
- **Castling:** Can castle with rook if neither has moved

### **Special Commands:**
- `help` or `h` - Show help and commands
- `history` or `hist` - Show move history
- `status` or `s` - Show current game status
- `moves x y` - Show legal moves for piece at position (x,y)
- `board` or `b` - Redisplay the board
- `savehelp` - Show save/load commands
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the game

### **Example Moves:**
- **White moves pawn from e2 to e4:**
  ```plaintext
  e2 e4
  ```
- **Black moves pawn from e7 to e5:**
  ```plaintext
  e7 e5
  ```
- **White knight to f3:**
  ```plaintext
  Nf3
  ```
- **White kingside castling:**
  ```plaintext
  O-O
  ```
- **Queen captures on f7:**
  ```plaintext
  Qxf7
  ```

### **Game Flow:**  
- The game alternates between **White** and **Black** turns.
- If a move is invalid, the program will notify the player and ask for another move.
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate are automatically detected and announced.

### **Endgame:**  
- **Checkmate:** When a king is in check and no legal moves can escape it.
- **Stalemate:** When a player has no legal moves but is not in check.
- **Game Statistics:** Total moves and complete move history are displayed.

### **Testing Castling and En Passant:**

**Test Castling (Scholar's Mate with Castling):**
```plaintext
e2 e4    # White pawn to e4
e7 e5    # Black pawn to e5
Qh5      # White queen to h5
Nc6      # Black knight to c6
Bc4      # White bishop to c4
Nf6      # Black knight to f6
O-O      # White kingside castling
```

**Test En Passant:**
```plaintext
d2 d4    # White pawn to d4
e7 e5    # Black pawn to e5
d4 e5    # White captures pawn
d7 d5    # Black pawn to d5 (en passant opportunity)
e5 d6    # White captures en passant
```

**Expected results:** 
- Castling should move both king and rook correctly
- En passant should capture the black pawn on d5

**Test Save/Load System:**
```plaintext
e2 e4    # White pawn to e4
save mygame.chess  # Save the game
load mygame.chess  # Load the game back
export game.pgn    # Export to PGN format
fen               # Display current FEN
```

**Expected results:**
- Game should save and load correctly with all state preserved
- PGN export should create a standard chess file
- FEN should display current position in standard notation

## **Classes and OOP Design**  

### **Piece Hierarchy:**
- **Piece (Base Class):**  
  Abstract class defining the general behavior of all chess pieces (e.g., validate movement).  

- **Derived Classes:**  
  Implement specific rules for each type of piece:  
  - `Pawn`: Can move forward, capture diagonally, promote to Queen, and capture en passant.
  - `Rook`: Moves in straight lines along rows or columns.
  - `Knight`: Moves in an "L" shape.
  - `Bishop`: Moves diagonally.
  - `Queen`: Moves in straight lines and diagonals.
  - `King`: Moves one square in any direction, can castle with rook.

### **Game Management:**
- **Board Class:**  
  Handles the 8x8 chessboard, including placing pieces, updating board state, printing the current board, check detection, game state management, castling validation, and en passant tracking.

- **Game Class:**  
  Manages the overall game flow, including turns, move validation, switching between players, move history, user interaction, and special move parsing.

## **Technical Implementation Highlights**

### **Memory Management:**
- Proper use of copy constructors and destructors
- Dynamic memory allocation for pieces
- RAII principles for resource management

### **Algorithm Complexity:**
- Check detection: O(n²) where n is board size
- Legal move generation: O(n²) per piece
- Game state evaluation: O(n²)
- Castling validation: O(1) with piece movement tracking
- En passant validation: O(1) with target square tracking

### **Design Patterns:**
- **Strategy Pattern:** Different move validation for each piece type
- **Factory Pattern:** Piece creation and copying
- **Observer Pattern:** Game state monitoring

### **New Features Implementation:**
- **Castling:** Piece movement tracking, validation logic, and notation parsing
- **En Passant:** Target square tracking, automatic detection, and capture logic
